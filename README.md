# @jorgecasar/Web-Project-Tools

This is a set of tools for web project that I was using in my projects. I decide to join all of them into a single repository to make it easier to maintain and use. Also are published in npm under the namespace `@jorgecasar`.

You can find the following tools:

- [@jorgecasar/custom-elements-manifest-config](./custom-elements-manifest/jsdoc/README.md): A set of rules for custom-element-manifest.
